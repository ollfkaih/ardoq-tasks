# Job interview tasks
Tasks given to me to show proficiency for internship at [Ardoq](https://www.ardoq.com/).

## Max product of three numbers
In the python script [Maxproduct.py](maxproduct.py), `max_three_product(list)` picks out the three biggest numbers of a list and multiplies them. 
The file also has a main method which loops through a list five times to test the functionality.

## Map of city bikes
[oslo-bysykkel-kart](oslo-bysykkel-kart/) is a react webapp, which fetches data from Oslo bysykkel's [API](https://oslobysykkel.no/apne-data/sanntid) 
and shows stations and how many bikes/parking sports are free on a mapbox map using [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/use-mapbox-gl-js-with-react/).
The app is a bit spartan, because functionality has been prioritized over design.
To run the react app, change to directory `oslo-bysykkel-kart` and run `npm i` and then `npm start`.
